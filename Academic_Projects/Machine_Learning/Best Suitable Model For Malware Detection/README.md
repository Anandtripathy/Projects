Aim: we have found the machine learning model for malware detection using machine learning life cycle which will help the organization to detect the data breach before it happens. The machine learning and deep learning can allow malware detection to discard its present clumsy blacklist policy and also help find out nearing threats with confidence. If the information on a hacking pattern or degree of detection in the future was predicted in advance to a computer user, similar to a weather forecast, it would help to make ready for and manage or survive with a cyber threat. Presently, there exist technologies Machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are commonly used in malware detection. The traditional machine learning algorithms have potentially learnt the behaviour features from the malware. For the research we are finding machine learning algorithms’ performance depends on the accuracy of the extracted features. Also, it is often difficult to extract meaningful behaviour features for improving malware detection performance So for that, we have used dimensionality reduction. Moreover, feature processing requires expertise and methodologies. The methodology is not dependent on any technology. Rather, a methodology brings a structure to accumulate outcomes by employing an extensive collection of methods, processes, and heuristics.
