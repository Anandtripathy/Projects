 # To visualize and analyse MplsStops.xlsx dataset which contains data pertaining to 34,178 stops made by Minneapolis Police in the year 2017 using Tableau 
 
 
**Context** 

Minneapolis city is split into 5 police districts in the state of Minnesota, United States to promote effective police patrols. Officers have the right to patroll their own precincts. They have power to prohibit people / vehicles from reporting criminal activity or traffic offences, and to search individuals / vehicles if considered necessary.
Only a limited number of arrests also warrant police intervention. If illegal / antisocial behavior is detected, steps taken may be prosecuted, or ticket issuing if traffic infringement is observed. According to the state law, the data concerned is entered into a central database by the officer concerned after each stop has been closed

**Task:**

Drill-Down Analysis Dashboard

1. Quick Filters: Three filter controls titled ‘Select Stop Category’, ‘Select Gender’, and ‘Select Search Scenario’ to filter all visualizations. The ‘Select Search Scenario’ filter control should have four options – ‘Person Only’, ‘Vehicle Only’, ‘Person & Vehicle’, and ‘No Search’ to allow filtering as per one of the four possible search scenarios for any stop – only stopped person is searched, only stopped vehicle is searched, both person and vehicle are searched, nothing is searched.

2. Visualizations 1 & 2: Display number of stops in precincts, and number of stops in neighborhoods respectively. Title them as ‘Select Precinct’ and ‘Select Neighborhood’.
Tooltips should display the following information -

          Visualization 1 - ‘Precinct’, ‘Number of stops’ and ‘Number of actions taken’

          Visualization 2 - ‘Precinct’, ‘Neighborhood, ‘Number of stops’ and ‘Number of actions taken’

3. Visualization 3: Display number of stops, and number of actions by month on a single chart.
Title this visualization as ‘Select Month’. Tooltips should display the relevant information. 

4. Visualizations 4 & 5: Display number of people searched, and number of vehicles searched
respectively. Title them as ‘People Searched’ and ‘Vehicles Searched’. Tooltips should display
the relevant information.

6. Visualization 6: A map to show locations of stops in the five precincts. Title this visualization as ‘Location’. Tooltips should display ‘Precinct’, ‘Neighborhood’, ‘Percentage of stops that required action in precinct in 2017’, and ‘Percentage of stops that required action in neighborhood in 2017’. Additionally, all such stops that required police action should be colored red, while others should be colored blue. 

Note: Action Filters are Implement the following action filters:

i). Source – Visualization 1, Targets – Visualizations 2,3,4, 5, and 6.

ii). Source – Visualization 2, Targets – Visualizations 3,4, 5, and 6.

iii). Source – Visualization 3, Targets – Visualizations 4, 5, and 6.
